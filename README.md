# Modern Admin Panel UI (no database)
This is an Admin Panel UI that I built with React.js, HTML, SCSS, Material UI to practice.

# How to run the app locally
1. Install npm and node.js
2. Download the source code
3. Run npm install to install all the required packages into the project folder
4. Run command "npm start" and open browser to try the app at "https://localhost:3000/

# Live page
Perhaps please try the live version of the UI here :) https://manhhuyvo-adminpanel.netlify.app/
